## Grading

Your grade will be determined based on
a written exam (70%) at the end of the course.
and final programming project (30%)
The grade scale below will be used to convert the weighted scores to a final letter grade.

| Percent  |    Local      |  ECTS |
|----------|--------------:|:-----:|
| >96      | 1.0           |   A   |
| 93–96    | 1.3           |   A   |
| 89–92    | 1.7           |   B   |
| 85–88    | 2.0           |   B   |
| 81–84    | 2.3           |   C   |
| 77–80    | 2.7           |   C   |
| 73–76    | 3.0           |   C   |
| 69–72    | 3.3           |   D   |
| 65–68    | 3.7           |   E   |
| 60–64    | 4.0           |   E   |
| <60      | 5.0           |   F   |

Besides the graded coursework,
the course includes introductory assignments.
Although these are not graded,
they are a core part of the class,
completing them is required for passing the course.

## Attendance

Attendance will not not be enforced. However, it is
**unlikely** that you will pass the course without regular
attendance. Presence sheets will be circulated during the course for
informational purposes only.

## Projects

The following basic rules apply the projects:

1. Projects that are not handed in timely are graded *0/100*. If you are
   ill, present a note from the doctor **before** the deadline.
2. If your code does not compile due to errors in your code, your
   assignment gets the grade *0/100*.
3. Code is graded for correctness and style.

You are encouraged to help one another in this course. We all need a
little help sometimes and you can also learn quite a bit from helping
others. However, there is a point where getting help turns into
plagiarism. The code that you submit, **must** be your own code. Cases
of plagiarism will be reported to the faculty.

- Discuss a general approach to the solution of an assignment with your
  classmates.
- Get help debugging your code, but only AFTER you have really tried it
  yourself.

Things you are **not allowed** to do:

- Use someone else's code (in whole or in part), this includes code fragments
  from web sites such as Stack Overflow.
- Give your solution to an assignment (in whole or in part) to a classmate.
- Get so much help on an assignment that you can no longer honestly call it
  your own.

### Submissions

In this class we will make heavy use of [GitHub](https://gihub.com/)
and [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).
Make sure to obtain a (free) GitHub account,
and familiarize yourself with the system
before you start working on your first assignment.

Assignments and projects are only accepted through the GitHub repositories.
No other form of submissions (e.g., email) are accepted.

The following information should be provided as the file/module
[docstring](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
in Python assignments, and as comments at the beginning of the file
for other file types that allow comments.

## Exams

The following basic rules apply for the exams:

* If you are too ill to take an exam, you must inform instructors by
  e-mail, **at least 60 minutes** before the beginning of the exam.
  You also need to present an attest from your doctor before enrolling
  into the re-examination.
* A re-examination of the final exam is possible, only if you fail.
